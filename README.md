## Features

- **Real-time transaction monitoring**: Analyzes transactions as they occur to detect potential fraud.
- **Scalable microservice**: Built to handle high transaction volumes with low latency.
- **Modular architecture**: Easily extend or modify specific components like detection algorithms or data sources.
- **Dockerized**: Fully containerized for easy deployment and scaling.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrated logging for tracking system behavior and transaction flows.

## Architecture

The project is structured into several modules:

- **cmd/**: Entry point for the application.
- **api/**: Handles the HTTP server and routing for API requests.
- **antifraud/**: Core logic for fraud detection.
- **config/**: Configuration management for different environments.
- **database/**: Database models and interaction.
- **logger/**: Centralized logging configuration.
- **server/**: Server setup and initialization.
- **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers.

## Installation

To get started with `go-antifraud-ms`, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/felipemacedo1/go-antifraud-ms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd go-antifraud-ms
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   go build -o antifraud-ms cmd/main.go
   ```

4. Run the service:

   ```bash
   ./antifraud-ms
   ```
<!--
Alternatively, you can use Docker:

```bash
docker build -t go-antifraud-ms .
docker run -p 8080:8080 go-antifraud-ms
```

## Usage

Once the service is running, you can send API requests to test the antifraud functionalities.

For example, to check a transaction:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/transactions/check -d '{"transaction_id":"12345","amount":100.00,"currency":"USD","timestamp":"2024-08-30T12:34:56Z"}'
```

## Configuration

Configuration is handled via environment variables defined in the `.env` file. Key configurations include:

- `DATABASE_HOST`
- `DATABASE_PORT`
- `DATABASE_USER`
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`
- `DATABASE_NAME`
- `LOG_LEVEL`

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/v1/transactions/check**: Check a transaction for potential fraud.

## Testing

Unit tests are located in the `tests/` directory. Run tests with:

```bash
go test ./...
```
